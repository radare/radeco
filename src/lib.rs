//! # The Radare2 Decompilation Library
//! radeco-lib is the crate that powers the
//! [radare2 decompiler](https://github.com/radare/radeco).
//!
//! Apart from decompilation, this library is designed to allow users to
//! perform static analysis on binaries in a easy and intuitive way.
//! __Reusuablility__ and __Interactivity__ are the most important
//! design principles of this library.
//!
//! # Design
//! radeco-lib is built on top of r2pipe.rs, a simple library that provides
//! methods
//! to communicate with radare2 (using pipes). To know more about r2pipe or
//! radare2 in general, please head over to the
//! [repo](https://github.com/radare/radare2).
//!
//! radeco-lib works on analyzing ESIL (Evaluable Strings Intermediate
//! Language), an intermediate
//! representation (IR) used by radare2 for emulation. ESIL is converted into
//! an internal SSA IR
//! and used for subsequent analysis and optimizations.
//!
//! __NOTE__: This library is still under heavy developement.
//! Some API's have been stabilized, please check the docs before using
//! radeco-lib
//! in your projects as changes may not be backwards compatible. Contributions,
//! suggestions
//! and bug reports are always welcome at:
//! [tracker](https://github.com/radare/radeco-lib/issues)
//!
