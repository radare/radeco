//! Defines the traits to be implemented by the Control Flow Graph (CFG).
//!
//! These traits extend upon the ones provided in `graph_traits`
//!
//! # Design
//!
//!  * `CFG` - This acts as the base trait upon which the
//!  whole SSA form is build. The `CFG` trait provides __accessors__ to the
//!  Basic Blocks of the program as well as the Control Flow edges that
//!  connect these blocks.
//!
//!  * `CFGMod` - This trait provides methods to __manipulate__ the Control
//!  Flow Graph.
//!
//!  The above traits are generic over indexes that are used to refer to edges
//!  and nodes in a CFG. `CFG::ActionRef` represents the type that is used
//!  to reference the Basic Blocks in the Control Flow Graph.
//!  Similarly, `CFG::CFEdgeRef` represents the type that is used to reference
//!  edges in the graph.
//!
//!  It is important to note that the trait `SSA` requires `CFG` to be
//!  implemented. The underlying CFG trait continues to provide access to the
//!  control flow structure of the program even in the SSA form. In essence,
//!  the SSA graph can be thought of
//!  as a composition (or superposition) of the SSA graph and the CFG graph.
//!
//!  Individual traits and their methods are explained in their respective
//!  docs.
//!
//!  Note: Reference in the docs refers to any type that is used to index
//!  nodes and edges in the graph and not necessarily __pointers__.
