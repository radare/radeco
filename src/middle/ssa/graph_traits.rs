//! Defines the traits to be implemented by the Control Flow Graph (CFG).
//!
//! These traits act as a way to abstract the actual storage
//! mechanism of the CFG and SSA.
//! Any struct that implement these traits can be used with other methods.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//!  * `Graph` - This acts as the base trait upon which the
//!  whole SSA form is build. The `Graph` trait provides functions to the
//!  Basic Graph Operation.
//!
//!  The above traits are generic over indexes that are used to refer to edges
//!  and nodes in a graph. 
//!
//!  It is important to note that the trait `SSA` and `CFG` require `Graph` to 
//!  be implemented. 
//!
//!  Individual traits and their methods are explained in their respective
//!  docs.
//!
//!  Note: Reference in the docs refers to any type that is used to index
//!  nodes and edges in the graph and not necessarily __pointers__.
