An ESIL Toolchain written in rust. For more information on ESIL, its usage and
semantics, please check [documentation](https://github.com/radare/radare2book/blob/master/disassembling/esil.md).

## Design

This repository is mainly divided into three modules. With very specific
function for each. The ideal end-goal is to be able to use ESIL for a specific
purpose by implementing only a particular component and reuse every other.
Below is the outline for the same.

- lexer.rs: Used to break up input ESIL string into `Tokens`. If ESIL is the
  `Input` Language of your choice, then this lexer can be reused. A new lexer
  has to be written only if the input language is something other than ESIL.

- parser.rs: Used to parse the `Tokens` generated by the lexer. The `InType`
  of `Parse` should match the `Token` type for `Tokenize`. As long as your
  lexer outputs `Tokens` (as defined in lexer.rs), this component can be
  reused to process the tokens that your lexer produces. The parser does not
  work as a standalone as a standalone and is to be embeded into an
  `Evaluator`. The parser does most of the heavy work in translating ESIL,
  leaving the `Evaluator` to only evaluate the Tokens that it returns to it.

- evaluator: The evaluator is the most interesting part of all. The evaluator
  can be anything from an ESIL-VM, to a ESIL to REIL converter, Symbolic
  Execution engine etc. It is upto the evaluator to decide what to do with the
  tokens that are returned by the parser. The implementation of the evaluator
  depends on the use case. Usually, this is the only component that is to be
  implemented when using ESIL for any analysis.

(TODO) To see a sample usage of an evaluator, check vm.rs or radeco-lib


## Todo

* Default Evaluator (ESIL-VM) implementation
* More usage examples and auto-documentation
